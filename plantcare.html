				Gardenia jasminoides, the gardenia, is an evergreen flowering plant of the coffee family Rubiaceae. 
				It originated in Asia and is most commonly found growing wild in Vietnam, Southern China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Myanmar, India and Bangladesh. 
				With its shiny green leaves and heavily fragrant white summer flowers, it is widely used in gardens in warm temperate and subtropical climates, and as a houseplant in temperate regions. 
				It has been in cultivation in China for at least a thousand years, and was introduced to English gardens in the mid-18th century. Many varieties have been bred for horticulture, with low-growing, and large, and long-flowering forms. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<img src="../images/sunlight.png" style="float: left;">
				It prefers bright indirect sunlight or partial shade.
				<br/><br/>
				<img src="../images/watering-can.png" style="float: left;">
				It is advisable not to water gardenias with very hard water. When having to water with hard water, it is possible to add some vinegar or lemon juice to it before doing so, this will lower the pH of the water.

				<p>
				<img class="myborder" src="../images/plants/lucky-bamboo.jpg" alt="icon"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				Dracaena sanderiana is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to Central Africa. 
				The plant is commonly marketed as &quot; Lucky Bamboo &quot;. 
				The plant has become the most popular indoor plant in certain parts of India, where the plants are usually imported from China and Taiwan.
				Dracaena sanderiana and its related varieties are popular houseplants. 
				It is a suitable plant in a confined space, and the most suitable place is a scattered light or semi-shade site because direct sunlight causes yellowing and burning of leaves. If planted in the ground, it loses its bamboo-like look and it would fill with a leaf-like shape like other dragon trees. 
				It is multiplied by cutting a part of the stem just above the eye.
				</p>
				<p>
				<img src="../images/sunlight.png" style="float: left;">
				Thrives in medium to bright indirect light and can tolerate low indirect light. Not suited for intense, direct sun.
				<br/>
				<img src="../images/watering-can.png" style="float: left;">
				Water sparingly. Lucky Bamboo plant doesn’t need a lot of water. In fact, too much is bad for it.

				<p>
				<img class="myborder" src="../images/plants/Monstera1.jpg" alt="icon"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				Monstera are species of evergreen tropical vines/shrubs that are native to Central America. Monsteras are famous for their natural leaf-holes, and has led to the rise of its nickname, Swiss Cheese Plant. 
				Two different species of Monstera are cultivated as houseplants - Monstera deliciosa and Monstera adansonii. Monstera adansonii is distinguished from M. deliciosa by having longer, tapering leaves, as well as having completely enclosed leaf holes. 
				Monstera deliciosa leaf holes eventually grow towards the edge and open up as they mature.
				</p>
				<p>
				Part of Araceae, the aroid family, they are one of the few aroids that produces edible fruit, particularly, Monstera deliciosa, though they rarely flower or produces edible fruit indoors. 
				Monsteras, like many aroids, were made known formally to the botanical world during the early 20th century, although they had been known for much longer by the indigenous peoples of Central America.

				<br/><br/>
				<img src="../images/watering-can.png" style="float: left;">
				Water weekly. Allow potting mix to dry out before watering. Soil about 1-2 inches down should be dry to touch. Water more frequently during warmer months and fertilize during growth.

			<!--Parlor Palm-->

				<p>
				<img class="myborder" src="../images/plants/parlor-palm.jpg" alt="icon"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				Chamaedorea elegans, also known as the Neanthe Bella Parlor Palm, is one of our favorite true palms. Parlor Palms are native to subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas. 
				With the right care and many, many repottings, the Parlor Palm can grow to well over six feet tall. But do not repot more than once a year, as their roots like to relax. 
				Although in the same family as coconuts and dates, which produce edible fruit from flowers at the top of the plant, this plant produces inedible fruit from flowers at the base of the plant. 
				Cultivated since the Victorian era, this species of palm is prized for its resilience to indoor conditions and reliable habit.
				</p>
				<p>
				This palm is also called the Bamboo Palm because it has attractive bamboo-like stems that also spread similarly to bamboo. The Parlor Palm is a wonderfully graceful indoor plant that is easy to maintain and grow.

				Thrives in medium to bright indirect light and can tolerate low indirect light. Not suited for intense, direct sun.

				Water weekly depending on the light levels provided. Allow potting mix to dry out completely between waterings.

			<!--Peperomia-->
			<h2 style="padding : 5px; margin : 10px 30px 0 20px; font-size : 100%; letter-spacing : 2px; border-bottom : 1px groove #3cb371; background : inherit; color : #9a3466;">Peperomia</h2>
				<p>
				<img class="myborder" src="../images/plants/Peperomia.jpg" alt="icon"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				The Peperomia genus has over 1,000 species, but only a dozen or so are suitable as houseplants. They’re diverse in appearance, some with heart or lance shaped leaves, others almond or oval shaped. 
				Their leaves can be solid green, marbled or striped — even gray or red. 
				Native to tropical areas like southern Florida, South and Central America, they can be found on the forest floor, making them suitable for lower light conditions.
				</p>
				<p>
				Peperomia is grown not for food purposes, but for ornamental purposes, as they are fleshy, succulent, colorful and adaptable.
				Like other Piperaceae, their flower spikes lack a perianth (petals and sepals), are borne on a spike, and the fruits are drupes.
				Peperomia have the ability to be propagated from any part of the plant, except for the roots. Stem or even leaf cuttings however can root if given proper conditions, which makes it quite valuable in the horticultural industry.
				This ability is more common in more ancient lineages, but randomly; and whether or not it is an ancient characteristic, or just an evolutionary quirk remains to be known.
				Being relatively easy to grow, Peperomias are also prized for their foliage and are definitely good plants for beginners.
				</p>
				<p>
				<img src="../images/sunlight.png" style="float: left;">
				Medium light and can tolerate low light. Can take up to a few hours of direct sunlight indoors.
				<br/>
				<img src="../images/watering-can.png" style="float: left;">
				Water weekly. Allow potting mix to dry out before watering. Soil about 1-2 inches down should be dry to touch.
				Water more frequently during warmer months and fertilize during growth. Generally, the plant will droop or leaves will curl to show that it needs more water.
				Do not overwater or keep the soil wet for too long, as this will encourage root rot.

			<!--Zamia-->
			<h2 id="Z" style="padding : 5px; margin : 10px 30px 0 20px; font-size : 100%; letter-spacing : 2px; border-bottom : 1px groove #3cb371; background : inherit; color : #9a3466;">Zamioculcas Zamiifolia</h2>
				<p>
				<img class="myborder" src="../images/plants/Zamia.jfif" alt="icon"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				The Zamioculcas zamiifolia – or ZZ plant — is a tropical perennial native to Eastern Africa that has become popular worldwide in recent years due to its tolerance of a wide range of conditions.
				 The ZZ grows smooth, naturally shiny leaves that range from bright lime in their youth to an emerald green in their maturity. Individual leaflets are typically one to three inches long.
				  They spring from thick, slightly bulbous stalks, which grow from large, water-storing rhizomes hidden underneath the soil.
				   The ZZ is a highly dependable houseplant because it can tolerate low light and has low water requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
				<img src="../images/sunlight.png" style="float: left;">
				Tolerates low light, but prefers medium to bright indirect light. Not suited for intense, direct sun.
				<br/>
				<img src="../images/watering-can.png" style="float: left;">
				Watering frequency depends largely on lighting conditions. Bright light requires more frequent watering; low light less frequent watering. Allow to dry out completely between waterings.
